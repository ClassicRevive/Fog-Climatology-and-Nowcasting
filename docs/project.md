# Project Proposal Template

Please come to your project approval session having considered the following questions. Not all questions are relevant for all topics.

You must have agreed the topic and have approval (on the project dashboard) from a supervisor.

1. What data will your project use?
2. Do you already have access to that data? Do you need to gather the data?
3. If required (eg, for supervised learning methods or to evaluate performance), is the data already labelled?
4. Identify 2-3 academic papers relating to your topic, e.g., the data, the methods or the application. (try scholar.google.com or ask your supervisor)
5. What evaluation metrics will you use in your project?
6. How will you know if your project has succeeded? That is, what will you compare your work to? For example, this could be a baseline or published state of the art performance or some form of qualitative measure of success.
7. What do you plan to do first?
